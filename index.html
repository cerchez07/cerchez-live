            <p>Hi, Iâ€™m Marius. Nice to meet you.
            </p>
            <p>I am a web developer with an obsession on learning as much as I can about anything tech related. I
                recently found a new hobby on self hosting and I am surprised how many truly great tools were developed
                for free with the only purpose to make the lives of other better. My plan is to develop something useful
                and to to give it back to the community. Will keep you posted :)</p>
